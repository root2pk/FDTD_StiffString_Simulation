# FDTD_StiffString_Simulation
Simulation of a stiff string with a FDTD model and a simplified six-string guitar.

'A4_Six_String_FDTD_s1760559_Premkumar' includes a stereo output with variable pan parameters ranging from -1 to +1.

'A4_Parallel_s1760559_Premkumar' performs the six string FDTD program using Matlab's parallel computing toolbox and parfor().

'A4_Chord_Program_s1760559_Premkumar' uses the the function 'A4_Chord_s1760559_Premkumar' to produce chords with variable properties.
